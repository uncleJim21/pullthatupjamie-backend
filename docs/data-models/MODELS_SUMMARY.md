## Database Design Patterns

### **Common Patterns Across Models**:

1. **Indexing Strategy**: All models use strategic indexing for query performance
2. **Timestamps**: Most models include automatic timestamp tracking
3. **Flexible Metadata**: Many models include `metadata` or `Mixed` fields for extensibility
4. **Status Tracking**: Processing-related models use consistent status enums
5. **Identifier Patterns**: Multiple identifier types supported across authentication models
6. **Virtual Properties**: Computed fields for derived data (remaining usage, eligibility, etc.)

### **Model Relationships**:

- **User** ‚Üí **ProPodcastDetails** (via adminEmail)
- **ProPodcastDetails** ‚Üí **ProPodcastRunHistory** (via feedId)
- **ProPodcastDetails** ‚Üí **ScheduledPodcastFeed** (via feedId)
- **WorkProductV2** ‚Üí **QueueJob** (via lookupHash)
- **User** ‚Üí **ProPodcastUserPrefs** (via email/user_id)
- **Entitlement** replaces **OnDemandQuota** (new unified system)

### **Migration Notes**:

- **OnDemandQuota** is being replaced by the more flexible **Entitlement** system
- **WorkProductV2** represents the latest iteration of content tracking
- Social media features are expanding with **SocialProfileMappings** integration
