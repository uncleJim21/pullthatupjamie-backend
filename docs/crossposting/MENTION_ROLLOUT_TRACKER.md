## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Schema Foundation
- [x] Extend `User` model: add `mention_preferences` (array of pins/adopted mappings)
- [x] Create `SocialProfileMappings` model
- [x] Define all identifier conventions (`pinId`, `mappingId`, `mapping_key`, etc.)

### 2. Upgrade Lookup Endpoint
- [x] Scaffold `/api/mentions/search` route
- [x] Implement search logic (Twitter API, mappings, pins)
- [x] Return unified results (Twitter, Nostr, cross-mapping info)
- [x] Return user's personal pins in results (placeholder for now)

## File Moves
- [x] Move `MENTION-SEARCH-API.md` ‚Üí `docs/crossposting/MENTION-SEARCH-API.md`
- [x] Move `MENTION_MAPPING_LIFECYCLE.md` ‚Üí `docs/crossposting/MENTION_MAPPING_LIFECYCLE.md`
- [x] Save this tracker as `docs/crossposting/MENTION_ROLLOUT_TRACKER.md`
